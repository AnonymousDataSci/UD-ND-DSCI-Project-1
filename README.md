## Installation 

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 and 2019 to see if the pandemic hat a significant impact on certrain metric in the survey. Following question where asked to answer it:

1. 1. How did the work amount change during the pandemic?
2. How did job Satisfaction change during the pandemic?
3. How did job satisfaction change depending on working hours?
4. How does work satisfatcon correlate to income"

## File Descriptions 

There is one iPython notebook which contains the exploration of the data to answer the questions. The Data folder contains the survey data used by this analysis.

## Results
The results can be found in the Blogpost on Mediuem [here](https://medium.com/@sascha.pava/how-did-the-pandemic-change-our-work-5ff06e75f6ff).
